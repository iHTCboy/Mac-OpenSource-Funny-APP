### CocoaPods app
The foremost goal of CocoaPods.app is to provide a full-featured and standalone installation of CocoaPods, instead of requiring users to install CocoaPods through RubyGems or Homebrew. In addition to easy installation, it also includes ease of updating.

It is able to expose this standalone installation in a command-line interface environment through the pod command-line tool, which it will request to install on launch of the application or through the ‘Install the Command-Line Tool…’ menu item under the application menu.
